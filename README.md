# Backbone PJAX Example

We need a webserver to get started. AJAX requests need to run on same host / port to prevent cross-site issues.
On **MacOS** we simply start python http server on port 8000 from within project directory:

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

.. and

    $ open http://localhost:8000

That's it.
